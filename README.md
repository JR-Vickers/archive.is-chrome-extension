An (unofficial) Archive.is chrome extension

Adds two context menu items: one to archive the current page, and another to archive a selected link, allowing you to archive a page without visiting it first (desirable if you do not want to give the target page your traffic.) The former feature is already doable with a Javascript bookmarklet provided by Archive.is, the latter is not.
